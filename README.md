# video-game-sales-forecast
The objective of this project was to predict video game sales by console, genre, rating, etc. given recorded data of games sales spanning over 3 decades.

After the dataset was cleaned, graphs and charts were created to identify console lifespan, sales over time by console, sales over time by genre, sales by region, and many other criteria. More focus was given to games sales starting from 2012 since the most recent consoles were going to give best insight on future sales.

It was discovered that the popularity of certain game consoles and game genres differed by region. Final predictions games were given individually by region.
